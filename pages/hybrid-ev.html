            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are vehicles that combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Unlike plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), HEVs do not require external charging; instead, they automatically recharge their batteries through regenerative braking and the internal combustion engine.

            <p>
                The key feature of HEVs is their ability to operate on both gasoline and electric power. The electric motor helps reduce the load on the gasoline engine, making it more fuel-efficient and producing fewer emissions. This makes HEVs an excellent option for those seeking better fuel economy without relying solely on electricity.

            <h2>How HEVs Work</h2>
            <p>
                HEVs operate by using a combination of an electric motor and an internal combustion engine (ICE). The vehicle can run on electricity alone at low speeds and use the gasoline engine at higher speeds. The electric motor is powered by a battery, which is recharged through regenerative braking and the gasoline engine itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many HEVs, the system decides when to use electric power or gasoline based on driving conditions. For example, during city driving with frequent stops and starts, the electric motor can power the car at low speeds. On highways, the gasoline engine takes over to maintain higher speeds and provide better efficiency over long distances.

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Fuel Efficiency:</strong> The combination of electric and gasoline power leads to better fuel economy, making HEVs more cost-effective for drivers.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Emissions:</strong> By using electric power in city driving and regenerative braking, HEVs produce fewer pollutants compared to conventional vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Less Dependence on Gasoline:</strong> Since the electric motor is used during short trips, HEVs consume less gasoline, which helps reduce the overall carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>No Need for Plugging In:</strong> Unlike plug-in hybrids, HEVs don’t require external charging. The battery is automatically recharged using the engine and regenerative braking.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs:</strong> HEVs typically have lower fuel consumption, which leads to savings on fuel costs over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher Initial Purchase Price:</strong> HEVs tend to be more expensive than traditional vehicles due to the additional components (electric motor and battery) required for hybrid systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Maintenance:</strong> Maintaining both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine can be more complex and expensive than traditional vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Life and Replacement Costs:</strong> While batteries in HEVs typically last for many years, when they do need to be replaced, they can be costly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Hybrid Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of hybrid vehicles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Hybrid (HEV):</strong> This is the most common type of hybrid vehicle. It can run on the electric motor, the gasoline engine, or a combination of both. The vehicle automatically switches between power sources depending on the driving conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mild Hybrid:</strong> Mild hybrids cannot drive using only the electric motor; instead, the electric motor assists the gasoline engine during acceleration and helps improve fuel efficiency. This system is generally found in smaller, more affordable vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV):</strong> Although not a full hybrid, plug-in hybrids combine the features of a hybrid and a plug-in electric vehicle. They have a larger battery that can be charged from an external source, allowing for longer electric-only driving ranges before switching to gasoline power.</li>
            </ul>
