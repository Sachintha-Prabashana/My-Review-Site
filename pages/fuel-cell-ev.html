            <h2>What are Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles?</h2>
            <p>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are powered by electricity generated from a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell. This process creates only water and heat as by-products, making them a clean alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles.</p>

            <h2>How FCEVs Work</h2>
            <p>FCEVs use hydrogen fuel stored in tanks, which is fed into a fuel cell. The fuel cell produces electricity by combining hydrogen molecules with oxygen from the air. The electricity powers the vehicle’s motor, while water vapor is released as the only emission.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of FCEVs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero emissions: FCEVs produce only water vapor as a by-product, reducing air pollution.</li>
                <li>Faster refueling: Hydrogen tanks can be refueled in just a few minutes, unlike electric vehicles that may take hours to charge.</li>
                <li>Longer driving range: FCEVs typically have a range of 300-400 miles on a single tank of hydrogen, comparable to traditional vehicles.</li>
                <li>Sustainability: Hydrogen is a clean and renewable energy source, which can be produced from water, biomass, or natural gas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges of FCEVs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Infrastructure: Hydrogen refueling stations are limited, making it difficult to refuel in many regions.</li>
                <li>Cost: Hydrogen fuel cell technology is still expensive to manufacture, which makes FCEVs more expensive than conventional vehicles.</li>
                <li>Hydrogen production: Most hydrogen today is produced from fossil fuels, though efforts are underway to produce it using renewable energy sources.</li>
            </ul>
