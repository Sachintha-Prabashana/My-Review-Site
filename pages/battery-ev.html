        <h2>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)</h2>
        <p>
            **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** are fully electric vehicles that rely entirely on rechargeable 
            **lithium-ion battery packs** to power an electric motor. Unlike hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles, 
            BEVs do not have an internal combustion engine (ICE), making them **zero-emission vehicles**.
        </p>

        <h3>How Do BEVs Work?</h3>
        <p>
            BEVs operate by storing electricity in large, high-capacity battery packs, which power an electric motor 
            to drive the vehicle. The batteries can be charged using **home chargers, public charging stations, or 
            high-speed DC fast chargers**. The efficiency of BEVs makes them **cheaper to run** compared to gasoline-powered cars.
        </p>

        <h3>Benefits of BEVs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Zero Emissions** – No tailpipe pollution, reducing environmental impact.</li>
            <li>**Lower Running Costs** – Electricity is cheaper than gasoline, and BEVs require less maintenance.</li>
            <li>**Smooth & Silent Ride** – Electric motors provide instant torque and quiet operation.</li>
            <li>**Government Incentives** – Many countries offer tax credits, rebates, and charging station subsidies.</li>
            <li>**Energy Independence** – BEVs reduce reliance on fossil fuels by utilizing renewable energy sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges of BEVs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Charging Infrastructure** – Availability of public chargers can vary by location.</li>
            <li>**Charging Time** – While fast chargers exist, full charging takes longer than refueling gas.</li>
            <li>**Initial Cost** – BEVs are often more expensive upfront, but savings come in the long run.</li>
            <li>**Battery Degradation** – Over time, battery capacity may decrease, though modern EVs have long warranties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Popular BEVs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Tesla Model 3** – Up to 358 miles of range and a high-performance option.</li>
            <li>**Ford Mustang Mach-E** – A stylish electric SUV with up to 312 miles of range.</li>
            <li>**Hyundai Ioniq 5** – Advanced tech, ultra-fast charging, and a futuristic design.</li>
            <li>**Nissan Leaf** – One of the most affordable EVs with up to 212 miles of range.</li>
            <li>**Rivian R1T** – A rugged all-electric adventure truck with impressive off-road capability.</li>
        </ul>
