      <h2>History of Electric Vehicles</h2>
      <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. Here are some key milestones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1830s-1850s:</strong> Early prototypes of electric carriages were developed, but they were impractical due to limited battery technology.</li>
        <li><strong>1890s:</strong> EVs gained popularity in the United States and Europe, accounting for about one-third of all vehicles on the road.</li>
        <li><strong>Early 20th Century:</strong> The invention of the electric starter for gasoline cars and mass production by companies like Ford led to a decline in EVs.</li>
        <li><strong>1970s-1990s:</strong> The oil crises and growing environmental concerns revived interest in EVs. Automakers began experimenting with electric prototypes.</li>
        <li><strong>2000s-Present:</strong> Advances in battery technology, particularly lithium-ion batteries, and the success of companies like Tesla have propelled EVs into the mainstream.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Today, EVs are seen as a key solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.</p>

    <section id="future" class="ev-section">
      <h2>Future of Electric Vehicles</h2>
      <p>The future of EVs is bright, with exciting developments on the horizon. Here’s what to expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Driving:</strong> EVs are at the forefront of self-driving technology, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the way.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid-State Batteries:</strong> These next-generation batteries promise even greater energy density, faster charging, and improved safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> EVs will increasingly be powered by renewable energy sources like solar and wind, further reducing their carbon footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Adoption:</strong> As governments implement stricter emissions regulations and offer incentives for EV purchases, adoption rates will continue to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Grid Integration:</strong> EVs will play a key role in smart grids, allowing for bidirectional energy flow and grid stabilization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By 2030, it is estimated that EVs will make up over 50% of new car sales globally.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="policies" class="ev-section">
      <h2>Government Policies & Incentives</h2>
      <p>Governments worldwide are supporting EV adoption through various policies and incentives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> Many countries offer tax credits or rebates for purchasing EVs. For example, the U.S. federal tax credit can be up to $7,500.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsidies:</strong> Governments provide subsidies for EV manufacturers and charging infrastructure development.</li>
        <li><strong>Emissions Regulations:</strong> Stricter emissions standards are pushing automakers to produce more EVs. For example, the European Union aims to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2035.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-Emission Zones:</strong> Cities like London and Amsterdam have implemented zero-emission zones where only EVs are allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Charging Infrastructure Investments:</strong> Governments are investing heavily in public charging networks to support EV adoption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These policies are crucial for accelerating the transition to electric mobility.</p>

    <section id="comparison" class="ev-section">
      <h2>EVs vs. Traditional Cars</h2>
      <p>EVs offer several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Electricity is cheaper than gasoline, and EVs have fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> EVs provide instant torque, delivering smoother and faster acceleration compared to traditional cars.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> EVs convert a higher percentage of energy from the power source to the wheels, making them more efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiet Operation:</strong> EVs are much quieter than traditional vehicles, reducing noise pollution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, traditional cars still have some advantages, such as longer driving ranges and faster refueling times.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="safety" class="ev-section">
      <h2>EV Safety & Regulations</h2>
      <p>EVs are designed with safety in mind and undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet high safety standards:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Safety:</strong> EVs are built with reinforced structures to protect the battery and passengers in case of a crash.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery Safety:</strong> Advanced battery management systems prevent overheating, fires, and other safety issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulations:</strong> Governments have implemented safety standards specific to EVs, such as crash testing and battery disposal regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Center of Gravity:</strong> The placement of the battery pack gives EVs a low center of gravity, reducing the risk of rollovers.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Response:</strong> First responders are trained to handle EV-specific emergencies, such as battery fires.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, EVs are as safe as, if not safer than, traditional vehicles.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainability" class="ev-section">
      <h2>Sustainability & Environmental Impact</h2>
      <p>EVs play a crucial role in promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduced Emissions:</strong> EVs produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional vehicles, especially when powered by renewable energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> EVs are more energy-efficient, converting a higher percentage of energy from the grid to power at the wheels.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery Recycling:</strong> Recycling EV batteries reduces waste and recovers valuable materials like lithium and cobalt.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> EVs can be charged using renewable energy sources like solar and wind, further reducing their carbon footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifecycle Analysis:</strong> Studies show that EVs have a lower environmental impact over their lifecycle compared to gasoline vehicles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By transitioning to EVs, we can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change.</p>
