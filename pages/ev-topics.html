        <!-- History of EVs -->
        <section id="history">
            <h2>History of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. Here are some key milestones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1830s-1850s:</strong> Early prototypes of electric carriages were developed, but they were impractical due to limited battery technology.</li>
                <li><strong>1890s:</strong> EVs gained popularity in the United States and Europe, accounting for about one-third of all vehicles on the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Early 20th Century:</strong> The invention of the electric starter for gasoline cars and mass production by companies like Ford led to a decline in EVs.</li>
                <li><strong>1970s-1990s:</strong> The oil crises and growing environmental concerns revived interest in EVs. Automakers began experimenting with electric prototypes.</li>
                <li><strong>2000s-Present:</strong> Advances in battery technology, particularly lithium-ion batteries, and the success of companies like Tesla have propelled EVs into the mainstream.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Today, EVs are seen as a key solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.</p>

        <!-- Government Policies & Incentives -->
        <section id="policies">
            <h2>Government Policies & Incentives</h2>
            <p>Governments worldwide are supporting EV adoption through various policies and incentives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> Many countries offer tax credits or rebates for purchasing EVs. For example, the U.S. federal tax credit can be up to $7,500.</li>
                <li><strong>Subsidies:</strong> Governments provide subsidies for EV manufacturers and charging infrastructure development.</li>
                <li><strong>Emissions Regulations:</strong> Stricter emissions standards are pushing automakers to produce more EVs. For example, the European Union aims to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2035.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Emission Zones:</strong> Cities like London and Amsterdam have implemented zero-emission zones where only EVs are allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Charging Infrastructure Investments:</strong> Governments are investing heavily in public charging networks to support EV adoption.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These policies are crucial for accelerating the transition to electric mobility.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- EVs vs. Traditional Cars -->
        <section id="comparison">
            <h2>EVs vs. Traditional Cars</h2>
            <p>EVs offer several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Electricity is cheaper than gasoline, and EVs have fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> EVs provide instant torque, delivering smoother and faster acceleration compared to traditional cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> EVs convert a higher percentage of energy from the power source to the wheels, making them more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Quiet Operation:</strong> EVs are much quieter than traditional vehicles, reducing noise pollution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, traditional cars still have some advantages, such as longer driving ranges and faster refueling times.</p>
